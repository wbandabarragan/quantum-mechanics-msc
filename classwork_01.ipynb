        "Consider an experiment of the photoelectric effect. The experiment consists of setting up an electric circuit embedding plates of different metals. We illuminate the first plate with a beam of photons of certain wavelength, $\\lambda$, and as the photons interact with the metal plate, electrons are ejected from it. The electrons then reach the second plate and an electric current emerges. To prevent these electrons from reaching the second plate, we can increase the voltage until the electric current becomes zero in the circuit. The voltage value at which this happens is called \"stopping potential\", $V_0$, which is defined as the potential needed to stop the photo-electrons with the largest kinetic energy (so $K_{max}=e\\,V_0$) at a specific wavelength $\\lambda$.\n",
