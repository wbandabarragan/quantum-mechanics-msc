    "## Problem 1 (6 points): Normalisation\n",
    "\n",
    "A wave function for a particle in a box of length $L$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\psi(x) = C\\,x(L-x)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Find the normalisation constant, $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Why do wave functions need to be normalised?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Using python, plot $\\psi(x)$ versus $x$ (plug some fiducial values for the constants).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 2 (6 points): The time-independent Schrodinger equation\n",
    "Consider the following 1D wave function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\psi(x) = A\\,\\left(\\frac{x}{x_0}\\right)^n\\,e^{-\\frac{x}{x_0}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$, $n$, and $x_0$ are constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Write down the time-independent Schrodinger equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Find the potential $V(x)$ and energy $E$, for which this wave function is a solution to the Schrodinger equation. Assume that as $x\\to +\\infty$, $V(x)\\to 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 3 (8 points): Infinite square well potential and expectation values\n",
    "\n",
    "In class we solved the Schrodinger equation for an infinite square well potential of width $a$. Such potential allows for bound solutions only as the particle cannot escape from the well. The solutions we found had the following functional form: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\psi_n(x)= \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}}\\,\\sin{\\left(\\frac{n\\,\\pi}{a}\\,x\\right)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "For the $n$-th state given by the function above, calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) The expectation values associated with the position $x$: $\\langle x \\rangle$, $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) The expectation values associated with the momentum $p$: $\\langle p \\rangle$, $\\langle p^2 \\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) The dispersions $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_p$, and their product $\\sigma_x\\,\\sigma_p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Use python to make a plot of $(\\sigma_x\\,\\sigma_p)$ vs. $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Is the uncertainty principle satisfied? Which of the $\\psi_n(x)$ states comes closest to the uncertainty limit?"
