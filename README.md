## Course description:
This course provides provides a review of the formal mathematical treatment of Quantum Mechanics. The course uses computational tools to study the Schrodinger Equation and its solutions for different potentials, emphasising on its statistical interpretation and its importance for the description of experiments at quantum scales. Topics range from wave functions, the time-independent Schrodinger equation, through Hilbert spaces and the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, to the description of the hydrogen atom and two-particle systems. The course includes examples of different applications of quantum mechanics, including writing Hamiltonians for different physical systems and extracting information about them.
