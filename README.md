# Quantum Mechanics for Nanosciences

## Yachay Tech University - 2022/2023

## About this repository:
This is a collection of lecture notes and programming exercises carried out as part of the Quantum Mechanics MSc course at Yachay Tech University from September 2022 to March 2023.

## Lecturer:
Wladimir Banda Barragán

## Course description:
This course provides provides a comprehensive review of quantum experiments and the formal mathematical treatment of quantum theory. The course uses computational tools to study Schrödinger's equation and its solutions for different potentials, emphasising on its importance for the description of experimental data at quantum scales.

## Saturday/Sunday schedule:

08h00 - 10h30: Lecture

10h30 - 11h00: Coffee break

11h00 - 13h00: Computational Laboratory

13h00 - 14h00: Lunch break

14h00 - 16h30: Lecture/Computational Laboratory

16h30 - onwards: Autonomous work/homework

## Evaluation:
Grading is based on homework (25%), classwork (25%), exam-like quizzes (25%), and a final exam (25%).

The final score will be computed based on the average of all homework and classwork done during the module.
